# Intrepid #

Intrepid is a replacement for Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) that allows for simpler and more transparent usage with more flexible control over session and security.

Any object implementing an interface can be used as a remote object with no changes. This allows even classes such as HashMap to be used remotely without any changes.
